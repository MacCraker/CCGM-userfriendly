![Crabiest Crab Game Mod](logo.png)

Crabiest Crab Game Mod, or CCGM for short, is a dll-injected mod for Crab Game designed to add additional features, such as commands and Discord integration. 
It can be used for hosting always-online servers, with support for multiple instances even on a single machine, or it can be used on the fly whenever you feel like running a server.

## Features
Here is a (noncomprehensive) list of features CCGM provides:
- Permanent bans
- Moderation teams
- Custom game modes
- Custom commands
- Points system
- Discord integration
- Leaderboards
- Ban logs
- Player reporting system
- Live invite codes and server info
- Chat logs
- Moderation logs
- Player stats
- Run multiple servers on the same machine with our sandboxie support
- Headless mode support to greatly improve performance on machines without a graphics card
- Watchdog to keep your servers running even when they freeze or crash (NOTE: if the system hangs, this can't fix that!! please monitor your servers!)

## Danilo's server mod
CCGM was inspired by, and based off of Crab Game Server Mod made by Danilo, specifically the version 1.3.1 codebase. It should be noted that it has been updated since then, but now the only updates are fixes. The main motivation for creating CCGM was creating features that didn't exist in server mod, such as a point's system.
It should be noted that, while CCGM was made using code from Crab Game Server Mod, a lot of it was revised. Nevertheless, you can find the repository [here](https://github.com/Danilo1301/crab-game-server-mod)

## Custom maps
CCGM has support for custom maps, which uses a modified version of [Crab Game Map Mod](https://github.com/o7Moon/CrabGame.MapMod) created by o7moon. It should be noted that both the server and the player need the mod, or else custom map's won't load.

## DLL injector
CCGM uses [Nefarius Injector](https://github.com/nefarius/Injector) for DLL injection, but others may work too.

## Disclaimer

I am a self-taught programmer who created this in my free time. There is a TON of room for updates and improvements. There is no guarantee that this software will work as intended. That said, please don't hesitate to send me your suggestions.
